 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The Options Core plugin revamps the Options Menu Scene in RPG Maker MZ to be
 * more extensive and sustain a larger variety of options. This plugin will add
 * new options to the list in addition to options from other VisuStella MZ
 * plugins provided that they're installed as well. Game devs that are adept
 * with JavaScript are also able to add in their own options to the menu as
 * well.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Revamped Options Menu Scene and layout.
 * * The ability to add in your own Categories and options inside each of the
 *   individual categories.
 * * Newly added options like Master Volume, Window Tone support, and more.
 * * Integrated options added from other VisuStella MZ plugins.
 * * An added Playtest options category that is only available during test play
 *   to help speed up the game debug process.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Tier 1 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 1 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Major Changes
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin adds some new hard-coded features to RPG Maker MZ's functions.
 * The following is a list of them.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Options Menu Scene
 *
 * - The whole scene is revamped due to all the new additions provided by the
 * Options Core plugin. While basic functions will still work, do not expect
 * everything to integrate into it seamlessly.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Extra Features
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * There are some extra features found if other VisuStella MZ plugins are found
 * present in the Plugin Manager list. Most of these enable new options for the
 * Options Core to utilize as the code for them to work is found in the newer
 * plugins.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Many VisuMZ Plugins
 *
 * - Many VisuMZ plugins have options that become available when installed
 *   together with the Options Core plugin that wouldn't be available normally.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Understanding Options
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This section is to clarify a few things about the Options Core.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Global Settings ===
 *
 * The majority of settings adjusted by the player in the Options menu are
 * global settings. This is the way it is for base RPG Maker MZ without using
 * any plugins and this is the way it will be when using the Options Core.
 *
 * What does this mean?
 *
 * This means that if your player changed the Options settings, then loaded up
 * a different save, the Options settings do not revert to the settings from
 * the last time that save was made.
 *
 * Why is this?
 *
 * Because that is the industry standard. If the player wants to adjust the
 * BGM volume down to 50% from 100%, that means that when the player loads a
 * save file, the BGM volume does not shoot back up to 100%. Doing that would
 * require the player to adjust the settings multiple times for each save and
 * that just is not user friendly.
 *
 * Therefore, the majority of the Options Core settings are global for this
 * very reason and are not going to change because of it.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * === Exceptions ===
 *
 * There are a few exceptions to the rule. These exceptions are the three
 * settings that govern the "Window Tone" in the UI section.
 *
 * This means the values inserted for "Red", "Green", and "Blue" are saved
 * relative to the save file's settings.
 *
 * Why is this?
 *
 * That's because RPG Maker MZ's "Change Window Color" event command does the
 * same thing and we have no intentions of altering how it behaves to keep the
 * otherwise-global aspect.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Options Category: General
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following are the options that have been added to the Options Menu. This
 * is the default "General" category that appears with the plugin parameters.
 * These can be added and/or removed. If a new option has been added through an
 * update, then there's a likelihood of it not appearing due to the plugin
 * parameters not being updated with them.

 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Parameters: Keyboard/Controller Rebind Settings
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Requires VisuMZ_0_CoreEngine!
 *
 * These new Options Core menu commands will take the player to new scenes
 * where the players can rebind their keyboard or controller settings. This
 * will require the VisuStella MZ Core Engine in order to work.
 *
 * ==== Keyboard Limitations ====
 *
 * Not all keyboard keys are eligible for rebinding. Only a certain set of
 * keys are allowed. They are the following:
 *
 *   - Numbers on the top row from 1 through 0.
 *   - Tilde (~), Minus (-), Plus/Equals (+/=)
 *   - Keys A through Z
 *   - [ ] \ ; ' < > /
 *
 * The reason why only these keys are available is to avoid hitting any other
 * system bound keys like the function keys, caps lock, etc. These will also
 * function as a second set of controls with default controls bound to the
 * arrow keys, Enter, Space, Escape, and Numpad. This way, the player cannot
 * softlock themselves out of the key rebinding scene.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ==== Gamepad Limitations ====
 *
 * Just like the keyboard, not everything on the controller is eligible for
 * rebinding. However, the limitations are much less as the limitations are
 * only forbidden from rebinding the D-Pad. The reason for this is due to how
 * D-Pad actions may be hardcoded for some controllers and are better left
 * alone instead.
 *
 * Gamepads cannot remove individual keys from bindings like keyboards can.
 * This is because there's no fallback key that would prevent a softlock from
 * happening. Instead, they get a function to reset the controller.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ==== Late Retroactive Updating of WASD ====
 *
 * ---
 *
 * If you've decided to enable Keyboard/Controller Rebind, decided to enable
 * VisuMZ Core Engine's "WASD Movement" after your project has config.rmmzsave
 * in your project's /save/ folder, then the newly added 'WASD Controls' will
 * NOT be updated retroactively.
 *
 * This can be remedied in one of two ways:
 *
 * 1. Go into your keybindings and add them in manually (arrow keys still
 *    retain functionality). You may need to readjust the "Shift Right" option,
 *    too.
 *
 * 2. Delete the config.rmmzsave file from /save/ and the game will generate
 *    you a new one with the updated "WASD Movement" controls.
 *
 * This retroactive non-update will only affect your players if they've already
 * begun playing your game with a version before "WASD Movement" was enabled
 * and has a config.rmmzsave file already made. Players that are affected by
 * this can just simply update and add the 'WASD controls' on their own.
 *
 * Otherwise, a new player would not experience this at all.
