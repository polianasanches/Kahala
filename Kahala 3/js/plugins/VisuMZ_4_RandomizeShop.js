 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Ever wanted to create NPC's that sold a random assortment of items each time
 * you encounter them randomly through a dungeon? This plugin not only makes
 * that possible, but also stores their randomized shop data so that you can
 * recall it at any time or refresh their listing through the usage of Plugin
 * Commands geared towards this very facet.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Multiple Plugin Commands geared towards the creation of randomized shop
 *   listings with a variety of settings to choose from.
 * * Shop contents are stored based on the events that they were created with.
 * * If the player leaves a shop too learn, they can return to the last
 *   instance of the same shop with the same items that were randomized.
 * * Shop contents can also be remotely created, refreshed, or recalled.
 * * Experienced JavaScript users can create their own randomized shop contents
 *   through the Plugin Commands.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Tier 4 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 4 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Instructions - Quick Start
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Here are some instructions to get yourself started quickly on using the
 * Randomize Shop feature.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 1: Create An Event with a Plugin Command
 *
 * 1. Create a new event on a map.
 * 2. Open it up.
 * 3. Add a new Plugin Command: "This Event: Create New Randomized Shop".
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 2: Populate Shop Goods
 *
 * 1. Keep the Plugin Command opened.
 * 2. Add ID's to the "Item ID(s)", "Weapon ID(s)", and "Armor ID(s)".
 * 3. For the "Total #", add in how many items to acquire out of the pool for
 *    each category of items, weapons, and armors.
 * 4. Adjust the remaining "Settings" accordingly.
 * 5. For "Open After?", set that to true to immediately open the shop.
 * 6. Click OK to save the contents of the Plugin Command.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 3: Add in a Self Switch
 *
 * 1. After the Plugin Command is inserted, add in a Self Switch.
 * 2. Set Self Switch "A" to ON.
 * 3. Click OK to save the contents of the Self Switch.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 4: New Page
 *
 * 1. Create a new page for the event.
 * 2. Make the new page require Self Switch "A" to be ON in order to appear.
 * 3. Remember to give the new event page a graphic.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 5: Add the "Open" Plugin Command
 *
 * 1. Add a new Plugin Command: "This Event: Open Last Shop".
