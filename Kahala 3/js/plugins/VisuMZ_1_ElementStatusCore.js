 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The Elements & Status Menu Core plugin gives you more control over in-game
 * elemental rate calculations, providing Trait Sets to streamline assigning
 * elements to actors and enemies, and updating the Status Menu to display all
 * that information properly.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Element Rate control from target side and user side.
 * * Elemental Absorption and Elemental Reflection added.
 * * Assign items and skills to have multiple elements.
 * * Elemental rates can be adjusted from additive and multiplicative notetags.
 * * Forcing Elemental Rates and nullifying Elemental properties.
 * * Trait Sets added to mass assign traits through the usage of notetags.
 * * Trait Sets used to assign Elements, SubElements, Genders, Races, Natures,
 *   Alignments, Blessings, Curses, Zodiacs, and Variants.
 * * Randomized Trait Sets with weights to make enemies more dynamic.
 * * The ability to change traits midway through the game by Plugin Commands.
 * * Updated Status Menu Layout to display all this new information.
 * * Control over the information category tabs in the Status Menu.
 * * Change up the actor's Biography midway through the game by Plugin Command.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Tier 1 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 1 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Major Changes
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin adds some new hard-coded features to RPG Maker MZ's functions.
 * The following is a list of them.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Element Damage Calculation
 *
 * - Elemental damage was calculated in one very specific way in RPG Maker MZ:
 * getting the target's elemental resistance found across various database
 * objects and applying the damage to that rate. This plugin extends that by
 * giving more ways to extend the target's elemental damage rate as add in a
 * facet which introduces the attacker's elemental bonus damage, too.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Multi-Elemental Calculation
 *
 * - By default in RPG Maker MZ, if there are multiple elements assigned to an
 * action, then the element with the highest rate is taken. This plugin will
 * give you, the game dev, the decision on how this is handled: the default
 * maximum rate, a minimum rate, a multiplicative product, an additive sum, or
 * an average of all the elemental rates calculated.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Notetags
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following are notetags that have been added through this plugin. These
 * notetags will not work with your game if this plugin is OFF or not present.
 *
 * === Element-Related Notetags ===
 *
 * The following are element-related notetags.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Multi-Element: x>
 * <Multi-Element: x,x,x>
 *
 * <Multi-Element: name>
 * <Multi-Element: name, name, name>
 *
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - Gives this action an additional element (alongside the Damage element)
 *   when calculating damage.
 * - Replace 'x' with the ID of the element from Database > Types.
 * - For 'name' notetag variant, replace 'name' with the element's name.
 *   Remove any \I[x] in the 'name' replacement.
 * - Insert multiples of this notetag to allow unit to assign more elements.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Multi-Element Rule: Maximum>
 * <Multi-Element Rule: Minimum>
 * <Multi-Element Rule: Multiply>
 * <Multi-Element Rule: Additive>
 * <Multi-Element Rule: Average>
 *
 * - Used for: Skill, Item Notetags
 * - Changes the multi-element ruling for this action to either 'Maximum',
 *   'Minimum', 'Multiply', 'Additive', or 'Average'.
 * - If this notetag is not used, refer to the default ruling set by the
 *   Plugin Parameters.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Force Action Element: Null>

 *   Remove any \I[x] in the 'name' replacement.
 * - If multiples of this notetag are found across various Database objects,
 *   priority will go in the order of states, actor, enemy, class, equips.

 *   This merely adds onto it at the end after applying rates if the formula
 *   from above is unchanged.

 *
 * Trait Sets are new properties added to RPG Maker MZ through this plugin.
 * They're used to streamline the process of applying traits to actors and
 * enemies through the database.
 *
 * Instead of having to manually adjust the elemental rate of each enemy,
 * you can now assign them to a Trait Set (through the Plugin Parameters) and
 * then assign that Trait Set to an enemy or batch of enemies instead. This
 * means that all enemies with <Element: Fire> would be weak and resistance to
 * the same elements determined by the Elemental Fire Trait Set.
 *
 * These Plugin Parameters adjust how Trait Sets are handled on a general scale
 * within your game.

 * ** Main Menu Portraits are now forced to pre-load prior to entering the
 *    Status Menu scene to ensure images will properly appear.
 *    Fix made by Irina.
 *
 * Version 1.04: September 20, 2020
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** The "Column 1 and 2 Traits" plugin parameters for "General Trait Set"
 *    should now work. You will need to readjust them again. Fix by Arisu.
 * ** The "Elements" Status Menu Categories tab has its "JS: Draw Data"
 *    updated to display the percentages properly for Dealt Damage bonuses.
 *    This won't update normally as it's a part of the plugin parameters. You
 *    would need to do either a fresh install, copy from the sample project,
 *    or change the code bit yourself. To change to code bit, look for this:
 *      let dealtText = '%1%'.format(dealt);
 *    and change it to:
 *      let dealtText = '%1%'.format(Math.round(dealt * 100));
 *    Fix made by Irina.
 *
 * Version 1.03: September 6, 2020
 * * Documentation Update!
 * ** <Dealt Element id Flat: +x%> notetag gets a more indepth explanation.
 * *** This does not add on flat bonus damages after calculating elemental
 *     rates. This merely adds onto it at the end after applying rates if
 *     the formula from above is unchanged.
 * * New Features!
 * ** New Plugin Parameters added in Status Menu Settings for disabling the
 *    back rectangles and/or changing their colors.
 *
 * Version 1.02: August 30, 2020
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** Trait Set bonuses for X Parameters and S Parameters now show up properly
 *    in the Status Menu. Fix made by Yanfly.
 * ** Trait Set Sideview Battler Solo Weapon and Solo Motion notetags are now
 *    fixed to register properly with Battle Core. Fix made by Shaz.
 *
 * Version 1.01: August 23, 2020
 * * Bug Fixes!
 * ** Passive states now work with Skills & States Core. Fix made by Yanfly.
 * ** Fixed S parameters not working. Fix made by Yanfly.
 *
 * Version 1.00: August 20, 2020
 * * Finished Plugin!
