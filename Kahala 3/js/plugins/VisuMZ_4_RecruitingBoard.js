 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin allows you to create a recruiting board for actors that the
 * player can add into their party for a sum of gold. Each recruiting board can
 * have a different list of actors and even discount rates to go with it.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Opens a new shop-like scene for the player to browse through and select
 *   actors to recruit into the party for a sum of gold.
 * * Display the basic information needed for each actor akin to how the main
 *   menu is displayed.
 * * When used with the VisuStella MZ Core Engine, each recruitable character's
 *   base parameters are also displayed.
 * * When used with the VisuStella MZ Main Menu Core, the face graphic will
 *   match the setting used to display the map sprite or sideview battler if
 *   needed.
 * * A small window displays the list of skills the actor has learned, too.
 * * Notetags allow you to apply different cost rates per level.
 * * Discount rates can be adjusted via the Plugin Command.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements

 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations

 * VisuStella MZ library.
