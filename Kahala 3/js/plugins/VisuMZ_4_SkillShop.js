 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin allows you to call forth a Skill Shop that contains varying
 * skills that the player can purchase with gold to teach to various party
 * members as long as the shop's skill requirements are met.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Call forth a new scene in the form of a skill shop for the player to
 *   select and purchase skills to teach to various party members.
 * * Skills can have custom cost amounts.
 * * Skills can require certain party members to be at certain levels, classes,
 *   or even have learned other skills before being taught.
 * * Skills can also be locked away behind switch requirements.
 * * Different shops opened by different events can contain different skills.
 * * Apply a discount rate to the shop to reduce the cost of all skills within
 *   that shop.
