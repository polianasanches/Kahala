 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The Save Core plugin adds upon the existing functionality of how saves
 * operate in RPG Maker MZ and how the Save Menu appears in-game. Control over
 * autosaves is also provided by this plugin as well as the ability to make
 * Global Switches and Variables accessible across all game saves (including
 * new games).
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Save file technicalities including how filenames are made and or how
 *   forage keys are labeled to distinguish games from one another.
 * * Save types (standard, slot-locked, or single) to change saving to be
 *   suited for each game type.
 * * Save confirmation window added to relay information to player on whether
 *   or not a save has been made successfully.
 * * Global Switches and Variables that span across all saves and new games.
 * * Control over how autosaves handle (their own file, save over existing
 *   files, and/or both).
 * * Plugin Commands that enable/disable autosaves and forcefully activate them
 *   or request them.
 * * Change up how the Save Menu appears with various save styles.
 * * Add descriptions and pictures to the save files.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Tier 1 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 1 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Global Switches and Global Variables
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Global Switches and Global Variables are now added into the game engine via
 * this plugin. Global Switches and Global Variables exist in the same state
 * across all save files. This means if Switch 40 is declared to be a Global
 * Switch and is turned ON, then whether you start up a new game or open a
 * different save file, Switch 40 will be in the ON state. Similar will occur
 * with Global Variables.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * <Global> Switch/Variable Name
 *
 * To declare Global Switches and/or Global Variables, insert <Global> into
 * the Switch/Variable's name. That's all there is to it. Whatever value you
 * change the Global Switch/Variable to after declaring it will be changed
 * across all saves.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * NOTE: Tagged Switches/Variables are mutually exclusive from one another.
 * You cannot tag them with <Global>, <JS>, or <Self> simultaneously.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Commands
