 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The Main Menu Core plugin is designed to give you more control over the Main
 * Menu outside of RPG Maker MZ's editor's control. Game devs are given control
 * over how commands work, visual aesthetics pertaining to the Main Menu, and
 * assign menu images to actors as background portraits.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Control over general Main Menu settings.
 * * The ability to set Menu Background Portraits for individual actors.
 * * Flexibility in changing which commands appear in the Main Menu.
 * * Add new windows like the Playtime Window and Variable windows.
 * * Change the style of how the windows are arranged in the Main Menu.
 * * Change the way the status list is displayed and the way it's displayed.
 *
 * ============================================================================

 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.

 * VisuStella MZ library.

 * not they're visible, and how they react when selected.
 *
 * These will require knowledge of JavaScript to use them properly.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Command Window List
 *
 *   Symbol:
 *   - The symbol used for this command.
 *
 *   Subcategory:
 *   - The subcategory used for this command.

 *
 *   Icon:
 *   - Icon used for this command.

 * ==== Subcategories ====
 *
 * Subcategories are a new addition to the Main Menu Core version 1.18. When a
 * subcategory is set, it will only display Command Window items that belong
 * to that subcategory. Those Command Window items do not appear when there is
 * no subcategory active or if it's a different subcategory.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * To create a subcategory, a few things must be done:
 *
 * 1. The subcategory symbol must be "subcategory".
 *
 * 2. The string returned by JS: Ext determines the subcategory. In the default
 *    Plugin Parameters, 'datalog' is returned as the subcategory. This becomes
 *    the subcategory when picked.
 *
 * 3. For the JS: Run Code, have the following code somewhere in it:
 *
 *    const ext = arguments[0];
 *    this.setSubcategory(ext);
 *
 * ---
 *
 * To make a Command Window item be a part of a subcategory do the following:
 *
 * 1. Take the JS: Ext string value (case sensitive).
 *
 * 2. Set it as the target Command Window item's "Subcategory" value.
 *
 * 3. If the subcategory doesn't exist, then this Command Window item will
 *    appear normally.
 *
