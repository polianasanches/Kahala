 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin enables the game engine to use Pictures (normally available
 * event commands like "Show Picture" and "Move Picture") as Picture Busts,
 * similar to those seen in Visual Novels. These Picture Busts are given a
 * plethora of Plugin Commands to utilize and control them in ways to help
 * create narratives amongst characters akin to Visual Novels. The Plugin
 * Commands will also help streamline and remove the more tedious aspects of
 * trying to recreate a similar bust system with vanilla RPG Maker MZ.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Streamlined Plugin Commands to allow for commonly seen Picture Bust usage
 *   commonly found in Visual Novel genre-type games.
 * * Quickly Enter/Exit busts with Plugin Commands with a structure based
 *   around simplified screen positioning rather than exact coordinates.
 * * Change Picture Bust graphics without needing to fiddle with any other
 *   property for quicker switching between expressions or poses.
 * * Mirror, unmirror, or simply flip one direction to another for Picture
 *   Busts with ease without altering any other property.
 * * Fade in, fade out, or fade to exact opacity amounts without needing to
 *   alter any other property.
 * * Play Battle Animations on Picture Busts. Normally, Battle Animations would
 *   appear behind pictures, but this plugin creates specially effects to allow
 *   for them to play on top of the Picture Busts themselves.
 * * Move Picture Busts around relatively or to exact coordinates or using the
 *   plugin's predetermined positions in a streamlined fashion.
 * * Scale Picture Busts to enlarge them or shrink them while keeping other
 *   properties intact and untouched.
 * * Alter tones/tints for the Picture Busts in order to portray an active,
 *   passive, or normal effect.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Required Plugin List ------
 *
 * * VisuMZ_0_CoreEngine
 *
 * This plugin requires the above listed plugins to be installed inside your
 * game's Plugin Manager list in order to work. You cannot start your game with
 * this plugin enabled without the listed plugins.
 *
 * ------ Tier 2 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 2 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Quick Understanding on How Busts Work
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * These are some tidbits on how Picture Busts work.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Busts Face Left
 *
 * This plugin is made under the assumption that the Picture Busts are normally
 * facing left in their raw form. This is to match RPG Maker MZ's "Pictures" of
 * actors and to allow for more user familiarity with how Busts work.
 *
 * Naturally, you can reverse everything as long as you adjust the settings
 * properly in this plugin's Plugin Parameters.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Busts are Pictures
 *
 * "Busts" in this plugin are mechanically Pictures in RPG Maker MZ. The
 * properties that Pictures and Busts share are one and the same. This means
 * that you can control Pictures with this plugin's Bust-centric commands and
 * you can control Busts with "Move Picture", "Rotate Picture", "Tint Picture",
 * and "Erase Picture" event commands.
 *
 * Naturally, this also means that any Picture of Bust that hasn't been made
 * available through the "Show Picture" event command or "BASIC: Enter Bust(s)"
 * Plugin Command won't be able to use either event commands or Plugin Commands
 * related to the Picture/Bust manipulation.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Picture ID's Matter for Busts
 *
 * Picture ID's matter when selecting them for Busts. Picture ID's with a lower
 * number will appear further in the "back" behind other Pictures/Busts while
 * Picture ID's with a higher number will appear more on "top".
 *
 * It makes no difference if the object was formed as a Picture or as a Bust
 * first. The layer system is still intact.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Specialized Bust Origin/Anchor
 *
 * Pictures have two Origin/Anchor modes: "Upper Left" or "Center". The Origin
 * refers to the point in which the picture marks and aligns itself with based
 * on the coordinates it's given.
 *
 * If you are using "Upper Left", then the Picture's X and Y will indicate that
 * the Picture's Upper Left corner of the image will be at X and Y. If you are
 * using "Center", then that means the Picture's X and Y will indicate that
 * the Picture's Center point of the image will be at X and Y.
 *
 * Busts have a unique Origin/Anchor that can be setup in the Plugin Parameters
 * and it normally defaults to "Center Bottom", aka Anchor X value of 0.5 and
 * Anchor Y value of 1.0. The "Bust" Anchor works best with Busts because it
 * allows for the natural manipulation of busts relative to the bottom of the
 * screen position.
 *
 * As mentioned before, this can be modified in the Plugin Parameters. We don't
 * recommend changing it unless you know what you're doing.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Predetermined Positioning
 *
 * Messing with exact coordinates is messy and extremely inefficient when
 * working with them for a long enough time. This plugin offers a Predetermined
 * Position coordinate system, to which, the rest of the plugin will refer to
 * as "Positions" for short.
 *
 * There are 11 Positions available through this plugin, one for each number
 * between 0 and 10. These Positions start on the left side of the screen and
 * go towards the right, with a 200 pixel buffer from the edges. They are also
 * aligned at the bottom of the screen.
 *
 * In other words, something like this:
 *

 * +--------+--------------------------------------------------------+--------+
 *
 * These Positions can be changed in the Plugin Parameters if you understand
 * JavaScript code. If you do not, we do NOT recommend tinkering with it.
 *
 * This means if the Position 0 is used, the Picture Bust will appear centered
 * at the bottom of the far left side of the screen with a 200 distance buffer.
 * If the Position 5 is used, the Picture Bust will appear at the center bottom
 * of the screen. If the Position 8 is used, the Picture Bust will appear about
 * 3/4ths the way across the screen from the left.
