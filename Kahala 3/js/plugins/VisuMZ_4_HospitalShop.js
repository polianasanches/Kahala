 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * In most RPG's, inns are often used to allow parties to recover their health,
 * restore their status, etc. It's often a cure-all for a set price. This
 * hospital setting, however, charges based on the amount of damage taken, to
 * the amount of mana consumed, and the state ailments inflicted also have a
 * bearing on the cost. Players can also heal individual members as opposed to
 * all members of their party in the event that they cannot heal the whole
 * party. This provides a challenge to the player and also provides a more
 * cost-proportional way of recovering from damage obtained through battle.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Heal individual actors based on the amount of HP damage they've taken, MP
 *   that they've consumed, or states afflicted upon them.
 * * Heals all party members at a single time with a discount, too.
 * * Adjust the cost of healing each HP, MP, revival, and state recovery.
 * * Special notetags that allow you to change the cost for specific states.
 * * Plugin Command allow you to call up the hospital scene from the map.
 *
