 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Not all NPC peddlers have infinite stocks of items. Sometimes, it makes more
 * sense for them to only sell whatever they have on hand, regardless of the
 * item's usual limitability. This plugin allows you to switch between a "One
 * Time Purchase" mode where item entries can only be bought once in a store
 * versus unlimited. To sell more than one of a specific item type, just add
 * more entries to it. However, anything that has been bought will remain sold
 * out until the NPC peddler restocks.
 *
 * Features include all (but not limited to) the following:
 *
 * * Plugin Command that lets you switch between "One Time Purchase" mode for
 *   single entry buy versus unlimited buy.
 * * Shop contents are stored based on what the player has bought.
 * * Plugin Commands allow for the player to revisit those instances of the
 *   shop where the item entries have already been bought.
 * * Inserting multiple copies of the item type in a shop's goods listing will
 *   allow for the player to buy multiples in restricted form.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Requirements
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * This plugin is made for RPG Maker MZ. This will not work in other iterations
 * of RPG Maker.
 *
 * ------ Required Plugin List ------
 *
 * * VisuMZ_1_ItemsEquipsCore
 *
 * This plugin requires the above listed plugins to be installed inside your
 * game's Plugin Manager list in order to work. You cannot start your game with
 * this plugin enabled without the listed plugins.
 *
 * ------ Tier 3 ------
 *
 * This plugin is a Tier 3 plugin. Place it under other plugins of lower tier
 * value on your Plugin Manager list (ie: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). This is to ensure
 * that your plugins will have the best compatibility with the rest of the
 * VisuStella MZ library.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Instructions - Quick Start
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Here are some instructions to get yourself started quickly on using the
 * Randomize Shop feature.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 1: Create An Event with a Plugin Command
 *
 * 1. Create a new event on a map.
 * 2. Open it up.
 * 3. Add a new Plugin Command: "Mode: Enable One Time Purchase Mode?".
 * 4. Set the "Enable/Disable" parameter to "true".
 * 5. Click OK to save the contents of the Plugin Command.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 2: Populate Shop Goods
 *
 * 1. Create a new event command with "Shop Processing".
 * 2. Add merchanise to it.
 * 3. Add three copies of "Potion" (yes, the same exact item).
 * 4. This will be used to demonstrate how to purchase multiple "copies" of the
 *    items in limited form.
 * 5. Any price variations among the copies will be based on the first copy of
 *    the item listed. This is how vanilla RPG Maker MZ handles it.
 * 6. Add in other items, too.
 * 7. Click OK to save the contents of the "Shop Processing" event.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 3: Close the One Time Purchase Mode:
 *
 * 1. Add a new Plugin Command: "Mode: Enable One Time Purchase Mode?".
 * 2. Set the "Enable/Disable" parameter to "false".
 * 3. Click OK to save the contents of the Plugin Command.
 * 4. This is so that the mode does not affect other shops.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 4: Add in a Self Switch
 *
 * 1. After the Plugin Command is inserted, add in a Self Switch.
 * 2. Set Self Switch "A" to ON.
 * 3. Click OK to save the contents of the Self Switch.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 5: New Page
 *
 * 1. Create a new page for the event.
 * 2. Make the new page require Self Switch "A" to be ON in order to appear.
 * 3. Remember to give the new event page a graphic.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Step 6: Add the "Open" Plugin Command
 *
 * 1. Add a new Plugin Command: "Mode: Enable One Time Purchase Mode?" with
 *    the setting set to true.
 * 2. Add a new Plugin Command: "This Event: Open Last Shop".
 * 3. Add a new Plugin Command: "Mode: Enable One Time Purchase Mode?" with
 *    the setting set to false.
 * 4. Save the event.
 * 5. Save your game and Play Test it.
